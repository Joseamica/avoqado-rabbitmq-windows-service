Description:
POS Event Integration Service
This application serves as a middleware integration service between point-of-sale (POS) systems and a central event processing system using RabbitMQ.
Core Functionality:
Database Change Tracking: Monitors SQL Server tables (TicketEvents, ProductEvents, PaymentEvents, TurnoEvents) for changes using SQL Server's change tracking.
Event Publication: Publishes detected changes as structured messages to RabbitMQ queues with appropriate routing.
Deduplication: Ensures each business event is processed exactly once, even with multiple POS terminals operating simultaneously.
Transaction Management: Uses database transactions to prevent race conditions.
Key Components:
Change Tracking Service: Configures database change tracking, polls for changes at regular intervals.
RabbitMQ Publisher: Reliably publishes events to queues with proper metadata and venue identification.
Event Processing Logic: Transforms database records into standardized message formats for different event types.
Business Events:
Ticket Events: Opening, closing, splitting, or modifying customer bills/tickets
Product Events: Adding, removing, or modifying ordered items
Payment Events: Processing various payment methods (cash, credit card, etc.)
Shift Events (Turnos): Opening/closing cash register shifts with financial reconciliation
Design Principles:
Reliability: Events must be delivered exactly once
Performance: Minimize database load while ensuring timely event processing
Scalability: Support multiple POS terminals and concurrent processing
Error Handling: Proper logging and recovery from failures
Transaction Handling Guidelines:
All event processing functions should use SERIALIZABLE transactions
Queries should filter out records already being processed (Response IS NULL)
Records should be marked as "processing" within a transaction before publishing
Use strong deduplication keys based on business identifiers (WorkspaceId, UniqueBillCodePos)
